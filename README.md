# Automobile Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of automobile specifications to uncover trends, correlations, and insights into vehicle performance, pricing, and features. The goal is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to better understand the relationships between different factors such as engine size, fuel efficiency, and price.

## Objectives
1. Clean and preprocess the raw automobile dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
3. Visualize key relationships such as the effect of engine size on fuel consumption, price vs horsepower, etc.
4. Generate insights to guide potential buyers or automobile manufacturers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn: For regression and correlation analysis.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project contains various specifications of automobiles, such as:
- **Engine size**: Displacement or engine capacity.
- **Horsepower**: A measure of engine power.
- **Fuel type**: Gasoline, diesel, or others.
- **Price**: The market price of the automobile.
- **City/Highway MPG**: Fuel efficiency.

The dataset is available in the folder as a CSV file.

## Data Cleaning
Before performing analysis, data cleaning was a crucial step to ensure the dataset was usable. This included:
- Handling missing values (e.g., missing prices or engine sizes).
- Correcting data types (e.g., converting numerical columns stored as strings).
- Removing duplicate records.
- Outlier detection and treatment for values such as price and horsepower.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis explored the following key areas:
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identified correlations between engine size, horsepower, and price.
- **Price Distribution:** Visualized price distribution and identified key factors affecting automobile prices.
- **Fuel Efficiency vs Engine Size:** Examined how fuel efficiency changes with different engine sizes.
- **Make and Model Trends:** Explored trends across different manufacturers.

## Visualizations
Visualizations were created to illustrate these relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Key Insights:
1. **Engine Size vs Price:** Larger engine sizes tend to correlate with higher prices.
2. **Fuel Efficiency:** Cars with larger engines generally have lower fuel efficiency (both city and highway).
3. **Horsepower vs Price:** Vehicles with more horsepower are generally priced higher.
4. **Fuel Type:** Gasoline-powered vehicles dominate the dataset, while diesel vehicles have a slight price advantage in terms of efficiency.


## Results

The results of the analysis provide insights into how various features like engine size, horsepower, and fuel type impact the pricing and performance of automobiles. The visualizations created help explain these relationships clearly for potential automobile buyers or manufacturers.
